    <p>This is the demo app (aka dummy) for this project.
      The demo app is NOT the expected user interface - it is merely a test-harness used
      during development and testing, and serves as an example of how to use the Services
      in  your own application.</p>
    <p>The addon itself is simply the services used to communicate with the Portal API</p>
